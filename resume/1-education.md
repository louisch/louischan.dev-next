## Education

### **Imperial College London,** UK — *Computing MEng*

#### *September 2013 - July 2017*

The computing degree in ICL focuses on providing useful practical experience to students, with group projects working with large codebases, and considerable workloads, such as writing a compiler from scratch, or adding features to an operating system. It was a useful combination of both theory and practical.

### **Tapton School,** Sheffield, UK — *4 A-Levels A\*A\*AA*

*September 2006 - July 2013*

I achieved two A\*s and two As in Maths, Further Maths, Physics, and Chemistry during my A-Levels.
