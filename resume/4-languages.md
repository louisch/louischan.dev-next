## **Languages**

### **English**

I grew up in England, so I am fluent in English.

### **Chinese**

My parents are from Macau, so I speak everyday conversational level of Cantonese Chinese. I can also read enough Written Chinese to get by in everyday life, as I have been living in Macau for the past 3 years.

### **Japanese**

I consume Japanese media regularly, and have studied Japanese in the past to the level where I can understand about 80% of everyday conversations.
