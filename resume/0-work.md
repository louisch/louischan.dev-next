## Work

### **BottleTech Limited (平科技),** — Macau, Full-Stack Engineer

#### *February 2018 - PRESENT*

This has been my main career since graduating my degree. The company is quite small and has a wide range of focuses, allowing me the freedom to gain experience with an equally wide range of technologies. During my time here, I have built websites, apps, and VR experiences, usually from scratch.

The bulk of the websites were written using Laravel as a backend, and React or Vue as the frontend. We currently use AWS Lightsail to host these websites (previously we used a shared host).

I wrote a native Android app called Parker, where I was able to learn modern Android development techniques. I have also done work to upgrade an old (version 4X) React Native app to the latest version of RN, where I learned a little about iOS mobile development.

We also create VR Experiences using Unity, running on Oculus Quest now, and Daydream before then.
